    <h1>About Ja Morant</h1>
    <h2>His childhood leading to him getting drafted to the Grizzlies</h2>
    <p>Ja Morant is a professional basketball player who plays for the Memphis Grizzlies. Temetrius Jamel Morant was born in Dalzell, South Carolina.
        Ja frequently trained in the backyard with his father, Tee Morant, who taught him things like the step back jump shot and brought home tractor tires to practice jumping
        and soft landing. Morant played in the AAU circuit and played with Zion Williamson for one season. Morant attended Crestwood High School in Sumter, South Carolina.
        Morant was the leading scorer for the school, dropping a total of 1679 points across four years. He went to Murray State for college, recording stats like double doubles and triple doubles
        for the team. In his sophomore year, he assumed a leading position for Murray State, breaking school records left and right and dominating the league. He was one of 20 players invited to Chris Paul's Elite Guard Camp, which Morant called, "an honor".
        Morant became the first NCAA player to ever average at least 20 points and 10 assists per game in a single season. He also became the eighth player to officially record a triple-double in the history of the tournament, 
        and the first player since Draymond Green in 2012. Following Murray State's loss in the 2019 NCAA men's basketball tournament, Morant decided that he would forfeit his final two seasons of college eligibility and enter the 2019 NBA draft.
    Morant was drafted second overall during the 2019 NBA draft by the Memphis Grizzlies. On July 2, 2019, he signed a four-year contract worth $39.6 million with the Grizzlies.
